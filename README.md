One of these days I'll have time to actually update this micro-site, but chances are that you've come here by mistake looking for one of the repos/web sites listed below.

## Teaching


### Code Camp

This resource is intended to help students quickly acquire the basics of coding in Python (up to the point of using functions) so that they are less overwhelmed during the first few weeks of term. You can run Python code in the browser, allowing for interactive exploration alongside the basic teaching materials.

### Foundations of Spatial Data Science (CASA0013)

This is a significant evolution from the work I originally developed while in the Department of Geography at King's College London. The whole thing is now built in Quarto (including practical notebooks) and then pushed to GitHub.io.

[Access the FSDS micro-site](https://jreades.github.io/fsds/).

### Spatial Data Science Computing Environment

This repo contains the information need to generate a Docker image for use by students on CASA0013 and other CASA modules. We build a custom Anaconda environment, add Quarto and a couple of other tools, and add some fonts so that students have some choices about how their reports look in Quarto.

### Flip

Not yet public, but hopefully finished soon is a set of scripts that allow you to easily maintain a set of open source teaching resources for use in a 'flipped' teaching format. 

[Access the Flipped resources](https://github.com/jreades/flip/).

### Q&A Plugin

A simple Quarto plugin that allows you to develop a question and answer code block side-by-side, but only one is passed through on rendering to the notebook, PDF, or HTML output. So it becomes possible to, for instance, include the question with the iPython notebook, and the answer in the PDF.

[Access the QNA documentation](https://github.com/jreades/qna).
